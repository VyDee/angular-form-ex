Validation Classes in Angular
    -- ng-untouched (matches with untouched property in NgModel)
        ** field starts off with untouched classes

    -- ng-touched (matches with touched property in NgModel)
        ** when we click somewhere and lose focus, "untouched"
        will be replaced with "touched"

    -- ng-pristine (matches with pristine property in NgModel)
        ** field starts off with pristine meaning unmodified
    
    -- ng-dirty (matches with dirty property in NgModel)
        ** as soon as you modify the field, "pristine" is removed
        and "dirty" will place in there
    
    -- ng-valid (matches with valid property in NgModel)
        ** if the value is valid

    --ng-invalid (matches with invalid property in NgModel)
        ** if the value is invalid

Example:
<input id="name" name="name" class="form-control" [(ngModel)]="userSettings.name"
              required #propertyTest="ngModel"/>
