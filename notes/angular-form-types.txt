Template driven forms vs Reactive forms

>>> Template driven forms
    -- use a component's Template
    -- unit test against DOM

>>> Reactive forms
    -- use a component's Template
    -- create a form model in typescript (this must by in sync
    with the template)
    -- unit test against form model
    -- validation in form model
